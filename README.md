# BasicServerArchitecture

The purpose of this project is to show some basic server architecture, and use TDD to develop it.

I have applied Transaction Script Pattern and Data Access Object Pattern, though only just started, so they are small examples.

The code is developed for video tutorial, eventually there will be a link here to the YouTube playlist.

Currently I just have some business logic layer going, with a bit of functionality about User.\
I would like to later expand with Task model classes.

So far I have worked with a MOCK for data access, and would in the future like to create unit tests for attaching a PostgreSQL database.\
Then maybe add the network layer, and tests for that. Eventually.
